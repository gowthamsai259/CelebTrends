# Backend

This folder contains the backend logic and API utilities for the SearchTrends Pro application.

## Structure

- `/api/` - API endpoints and services
- `/config/` - Configuration files (database, environment)
- `/utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
- `/types/` - TypeScript type definitions

## Features

- Search API services
- Database configuration
- Data models and types
- Business logic separation

## Usage

The backend folder is designed to contain all server-side logic that would typically run in a separate backend service. In this current setup, it serves as organized utility functions and services that can be imported by the frontend.

For a full backend implementation, you would:
1. Set up a separate Node.js/Express server
2. Implement actual database connections
3. Create RESTful API endpoints
4. Add authentication and authorization
5. Deploy separately from the frontend
